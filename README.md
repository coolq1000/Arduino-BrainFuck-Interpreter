# Arduino-BrainFuck-Interpreter
An Arduino BrainFuck Interpreter.

Use the arduino IDE to compile and upload this to your arduino.
I created this with the default IDE version 1.6.11 and an Arduino Uno.

#TODO:
**ADD Instruction '.'**

**ADD Instruction ','**

## Update

Unfortunately, I wrote this a long time ago... So I only just recently realized that it will not work with nested loops. Keep this in mind!
